# HappyGenyuanImsactUpdate
A hdiff-using update program of a certain anime game.

## Usage
You should have the following things:

- A game (for sure)
- One or more upgrade packages (zip file)
- A release of this program

You can use it by the instruction here or in the program.     
First of all, it will ask for the full path of game directory.      
Next, it will ask you to choose how to check the files after update:   
- 0 - Don't have any check
- 1 - _(Recommended)_ Only check file size (usually < 10s, very fast, in most cases enough)
- 2 - Full check on MD5 (the speed depends on your disk, it will take a long time if the data isn't on a fast-speed drive like SSD)

Then, you need to type how many zip files you have.     
After that, you just need to paste all paths of zip files at a time, then the update program will finish the update process automatically.

Enjoy it!
